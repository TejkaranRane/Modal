I recently completed a Profile Modal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on displaying user details dynamically through an interactive modal that opens with a smooth 
animation and provides a clean, minimalistic user interface.
This project allowed me to enhance my skills in DOM manipulation and responsive design, while also emphasizing clean, modular, and reusable code that can be easily adapted to other
applications. 
It’s been a great learning experience in balancing functionality with user experience, and I’m excited to share it with you all.
